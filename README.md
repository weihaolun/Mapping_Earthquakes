# Mapping Earthquakes with Leaflet

## Background

Disaster Reporting Network is a nonprofit company that provides data driven storytelling on disasters around the world. My mission for this project is to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. This project will be useful for the Earthquake Disaster Response team. 

The earthquakes map should be informative and easy to use on desktop and mobile phones. I have used the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website, traversed and retrieved the earthquake data using JavaScript, the D3 and Leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.


## The Map

- On the map, the magnitude and location of the earthquakes is shown in a popup marker. 

- The diameter of the markers for each earthquake reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. 

- Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

- A legend providing the context for the map data is located at bottom-right corner on the webpage.

- A select panel for map types and data types is located at the top-right corner on the webpage.

## The Challenge ([Click Here](https://github.com/weihaolun/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge))

**The purposes of the Challenge section are:**
1.	To see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.
2.	To see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
3.	To see the data on a third map.


**Deliverables:**
1.	Add Tectonic Plate Data
2.	Add Major Earthquake Data
3.	Add an Additional Map
